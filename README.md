Inspiration and some code was taken from k-stz [GitHub](https://github.com/k-stz/cl-ptrace)

# Liscense
**GNU**

# Aside
I'm recreating the cl-ptrace program from k-stz to get into process hacking and in the future, more serious hacking.
This is meant to be a learning experience for me to get into the world of hacking, learn more about computers as a whole, etc.
